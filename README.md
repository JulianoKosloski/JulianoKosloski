# Hello, fellow humans! 🦎 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @JulianoKosloski
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end development (Node.js/Express, Spring Boot, and Django) and front-end as well (Angular, Vue, and React)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack development by building my own websites and applications. I also develop Python scripts for automation purposes and web scraping
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of project involving these frameworks, especially linked to things I love (climbing, pixel art, books, music and games)
